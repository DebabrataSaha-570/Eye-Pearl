                                        As per the American Optometric Association adults who wear glasses or contact lenses and adults who are over 60 years should visit their eye care specialist every year or as suggested by the doctor. If the person doesnâ€™t require any vision correction, then a person between 18 and 60 years should visit the doctor twice a year.

                                        The tears in your eyes keep them lubricated and moist. That keeps your eyes comfortable. Dry eyes are caused when your eyes are not producing enough tears. You may notice a blurred vision, light sensitivity, redness, and itching in your eyes. Any disbalance in your tear-flow system can cause dry eyes. Other causes include natural ageing process, conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and collagen vascular diseases; less blinking or staring at computer screens or any other object for a long time without blinking

                                        The doctor may give you artificial tears and ointments to keep your eyes lubricated. The doctor may even opt for a procedure called temporary punctal occlusion to treat your condition.

                                        Eye floaters are tiny specks and spots that keep floating in your field of vision. These are annoying at times but usually are harmless. These occur when tiny pieces of the gel-like vitreous of your eyes break loose. However, if you notice flashing spots, then you should immediately consult an eye doctor.
